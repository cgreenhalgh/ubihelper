<h1>Live Replication Protocol</h1>

<p>Chris Greenhalgh, 2012-03-28</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Working notes on an application protocol for "live" state
replication over limited bandwidth and/or intermittent and/or
alternative physical and link layer transports.</p>

<p>Goals &amp; constraints:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Maintain a remote replicate of some evolving state</li>
  <li>One-way replication, i.e. this version does not consider multiple
writers to the same state</li>
  <li>State is subdivided into a set of key-value pairs, each of which
may be created/updated/deleted individually and atomically; later
versions may consider additional support for large and/or compound
values of a single key<br>
  </li>
  <li>Usable across a range of implementation platforms, including <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>desktop browser (e.g. AppFurnace simulator)</li>
    <li>mobile browser (e.g. AppFurnace on-device)</li>
    <li>native mobile application (e.g. ubihelper, PhoneGap extension
or other native app)</li>
    <li>multi-user server(s) (e.g. node.js server)</li>
    <li>embedded sensor server(s) (e.g. Java-based server on Phidget
SBC or desktop computer)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Copes gracefully with limited bandwidth and temporary losses of
connectivity</li>
  <ul>
    <li>achieves eventual consistency, even in the face of ongoing
state changes</li>
    <li>recovers after transport-level failures</li>
    <li>does NOT attempt to replicate full state change history, only
'current' state, i.e. timliness is more important than historical
completeness</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Provides status information to origin and replica, in particular</li>
  <ul>
    <li>at origin, what version of state is known to have been
replicated (and what version might exist)</li>
    <li>at replica, when a consistent/complete state snapshot has been
replicated (and the time of that snapshot)<br>
    </li>
    <li>at origin and replica, when last successful communication with
the other occurred, and whether this is believed still established,
known to have failed, or attempting to (re)establish</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>General/implementation Approach:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Socket.io has been used successfully to provide a common
networking interface for AppFurnace in simulator and on real device. So
the protocol will made compatible with socket.io, i.e. implementable
over socket.io and interoperable with a socket.io-based implementation
where socket.io is not used.</li>
  <li>The most performant transport option for socket.io is WebSockets,
although this is not currently available in the Android mobile browser
(and hence to AppFurnace). So native implementation(s) will use
WebSockets as a transport for IP-based communication.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-IP-based communication (e.g. Bluetooth serial) will also
use a WebSocket-based protocol layer (for framing and control messages)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

Protocol notes:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Explicit (application) message acknowledgements will be used
determine successful transfers of partial state (individual key-value
pairs).</li>
  <li>State snapshop comprises a map of key-value pairs, where each key
is unique.</li>
  <li>Origin will maintain an update queue, comprising a list or
key-value pairs, interleaved with snapshot markers (which indicate a
complete/consistent state view to that point)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>E.g.
an initial state { a : 1, b : 2 } yields an update queue [ { newstate
}, { update : { a : 1 }}, { update : { b : 2}}, { snapshot: T1
} ]</li>
    <li>An update for a to 3 yields additional updates [... { update: {
a : 3 }, { snapshot: T2 } ].&nbsp;</li><li>Without transactions every update is followed by a snapshot
marker; with transactions the updates comprising a committed
transaction are followed by a single snapshot marker.</li>
    <li>Deleting a key-value is represented by an update to null.</li>

  </ul>
  <li>When sent, every message is tagged with a state ID which uniquely/globally identifies this time-varying state set.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If a replica recieves any messages other than newstate for an
unknown state ID then it must reject it with an unknown-state error;
the origin should restart from a newstate and initial state snapshot.</li>
    <li>It is assumed/required other (e.g. transport-layer) constraints
will be used to ensure that messages are consistently delivered (if at
all) to the same replica.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Transport-level messages may combine several update(s) and/or
other messages in order to reduce overhead, all be it at the cost of
joint failure (transfer or ack). <br>
  </li>
<li>Origin will maintain information about state at replica: not
sent, maybe received-awaiting ack, maybe received-no ack, known
received.</li>
  <li>New updates are not sent until/unless they are followed by a
snapshot message.</li>
  <li>When send updates become maybe received-awaiting ack.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Snapshots are not actually sent as normal messages; sending is
deferred subject to acks received (see later).<br>
  </li>
  <li>For flow control, the origin will not send updates that are
followed by a new snapshot until the previous snapshot has been
completed or failed (see below).</li>
  <li>If the transport connection is found to have failed (explicitly
or by ack timeout at origin) then all maybe received-awaiting ack
messages are changed to maybe received-no ack. All older maybe
received-no ack updates for the same key(s) are discarded by the origin
(or could be kept, strictly, but depends what we try to infer!).<br>
  </li>
  <li>If
a message is acked then its state is changed to known received. Any
older known-received&nbsp; and maybe received-no ack updates for the
same key are discarded by the
origin.</li>
  <li>When
no messages are in state maybe received-awaiting ack then the snapshot
send attempt is complete;&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>if
there are no messages in state maybe received-no ack then the snapshot
state should be the same as the messages in state known received (where
key set to null is equivalent to key not being present in state), and
origin sends a snapshot message (without the state). If/when this is
acked then the client updates its view of known replica state to that
snapshot (if the client doesn't release the state until it knows it is
complete).</li>
    <li>Else
(there are messages in state maybe received-no ack), <br>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>send
a snapshot-incomplete message (without state), <br>
      </li>
      <li>if
there is no snapshot in the queue then re-add the most recent (failed)
snapshot</li>
      <li>for
each key in state maybe received-no ack, if there is not already an
update for that key before the next (most recent) snapshot then copy
the most recent maybe received-no ack message for that key to the front
of the queue and mark not sent (this should be the same as its state in
the
next snapshot, or null if not present; note that the update (also)
remains maybe received-no-ack until/unless the new message is acked).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If
a new snapshot is in the queue then all messages up to it can now be
sent (becoming maybe received-awaiting ack)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>If
there are two (or more) snapshot messages not sent then all not sent
messages up to the last not sent snapshot are merged, i.e. only the
last update for each key is retained and the ealier snapshot messages
are discarded.</li>
</ul>
