<h1>Ubiserver2 Design Notes</h1>
<p>Chris Greenhalgh, 2012-04-23</p>
<p>Two main services should be supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li>best effort, eventually consistent, streaming, state sharing (key-value set)</li>
  <li>reliable, durable, idempotent, distributed (remote) (trans)action</li>
</ul>
<p>Transport options are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TCP - between native applications</li>
  <li>Bluetooth stream - between proximate mobile applications</li>
  <li>JSONP over HTTP/HTTPS -&nbsp; between Browser-based application
(including AppFurnace and optionally Phonegap and desktop browser apps)
and server</li>
  <li>Websocket - between desktop browser (and future mobile browser) and server - (optional efficiency/performance enhancement)</li>
</ul>
<p>Related:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Websockets provide a socket-like API to browsers supporting
bi-directional message-oriented communication within the context of a
single (initially) HTTP connection (i.e. TCP connection) to the server.
Supports transmission of (distinct) binary and text messages.
Optionally supports different protocols and extensions (e.g.
compression).</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Websockets
specifies a Base Framing Protocol that support clone, ping and pong
control frames and simply fragmented text and binary non-control
(message) frames. This comprises an initial binary-packet 16 bit
header: <br>

FIN = last fragment; opcode 0x0=continuation (fragment), 0x1=text,
0x2=binary, 0x8=close, 0x9=ping, 0x10=pong; len=126 implies two byte
length follows, len=127 implies 8 byte length follows; MASK = data is
masked, key follows.</li>
    <li>Full functionality presumes an underlying connection. Batch
mode use (e.g. with JSONP) could use only text, binary and continuation
frames for message framing. Although control message types could be
used as a limited optimisation. But case would be needed in terms of
independent failure of each request. A sequence of (potentially
tandemed) gets could be made analogous to a connection. The first
failure would 'fail' that pseudo-connection. All requests would be from
the same client. The client would need to send a request correlation
token to the server in each request (could be a query parameter or
special first message). This could comprise a persistent client ID and
a connection (initiation) timestamp.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Use over simple TCP could replicate Websocket operation.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Socket.io provides one possible abstraction over JSONP and
Websockets. It requires the server to be a HTTP server
(of some sort). After an initial HTTP GET to establish the connection
it provides a message passing abstraction, with its own message
format/protocol and simple framing (where required, e.g. JSONP).Uses
heartbeats and timeout for softstate disconnection. Provides only text
messages. Probably best used just as a temporary (or Javascript-only)
abstraction over Websockets/JSONP. Question: do we trust socket.io
reliability of message sending/signalling of failure??<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Overview</p>
<ul>
  <li>Associations between devices (and between devices and services)
are assumed to be more durable that transport connections. Soft-state
timeouts and/or explicit user management are used to terminate/remove
associations.</li>
  <li>Associations are secure once established in that new connections
are authenticated before being assigned to an existing association.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>These aspects are provided by the current <a href="UbiHelperPeerNetwork.html">Ubihelper Peer Network protocol</a>. The initial client-server case would require new association with no pin, and re-connect.<br>
</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Within an association a state management layer would allow control over state sets being shared with and by the peer.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Propagating changes to a single state set would use the (designed but not yet implemented) <a href="LiveReplicationProtocol.html">Live Replication protocol</a>.</li>
    <li>This might be bootstrapped via one or more auto-shared state
sets, which could be used (amongst other things) to push subscription
requests for further far-end state sets.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
