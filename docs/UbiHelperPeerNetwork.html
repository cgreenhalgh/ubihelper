<h1>UbiHelper Peer Network</h1>
<p>

Chris Greenhalgh, 2012-02-21</p>
<p>Working/design notes on the peer networking element of the ubihelper service/framework.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Allow nearby devices to share sensor information, e.g. GPS
location, WiFi scan results, in order to (e.g.) control proximity-based
interactions</li>
  <li>Allow nearby devices to share identifying information, e.g.
Bluetooth MAC address, in order to (e.g.) support identity-based
detection</li>
  <li>Allow nearby devices to share other application-specific information, e.g. user actions, shared state<br>
  </li>
  <li>Operate (as far as possible) without infrastructure</li>
  <li>Operate (as far as possible) without internet connectivity</li>
  <li>Be at least casually secure, i.e. normal usage should not allow
third parties running the application to access your sensor information</li>
  <li>Support durable device peering, i.e. information sharing should
continue to work without further reconfiguration across a range of
"anticipated" challenges, including re-starting the application,
re-starting the device and moving between networks.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Target Android devices in the first instance<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Alternative deployment scenarios:<br>
<ol>
  <li>No GSM/3G (e.g. no availability, no credit, insufficient bandwidth, too expensive)<br>
=&gt; Use local WiFi - cons.: requires local WiFi APs (see notes below) [Priority]<br>
  </li>
  <li>No local WiFi (e.g. no availability, inadequate coverage)<br>
=&gt; Use GSM/3G - cons.: requires SIM and credit/contract; higher
latency; typically requires external (internet-connected) server as
rendezvous/message relay [Defered]<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Local WiFi options/issues:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Android devices only support peer-to-peer WiFi from version 4.0 (unless rooted), which is not yet widely available. [Defered]<br>
  </li>
  <li>An Android device (at least a Nexus S) operating as a mobile hub does <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span>
report a local Wireless network/IP via the WirelessManager, so it is
not clear how it could take part in multicast discovery. [Defered]<br>
  </li>
  <li>=&gt; current compromise requires at least local Access Point(s)
for device discovery and communication, although internet connectivity
need not be required/used. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
Other common networking issues:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A device on WiFi or GSM/3G typically has a dynamic IP address
obtained via DHCP, which may change over time and till change when
moving between wireless networks.</li>
</ul>
Strategy:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Allow mutual peering of devices, c.f. Bluetooth. This establishes
a secure association between the devices including mutually identifying
information and a shared secret.</li>
  <li>Peering requires a two-way exchange between the devices, with user involvement (initiation or approval).</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A trusted service could do this on behalf of the device in an (at least partially) internet connected scenario.</li>
    <li>Can be established directly between devices (as with Bluetooth)
over a local communication channel: WiFi [Priority] or Bluetooth or
RFID or audio or mutual-visual</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Local peering requires</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial discovery of compatible devices<br>
=&gt; mDNS Service Discovery PTR query for "_ubihelper._tcp.local",
which returns a domain name including a leading instance name (plus the
service name and domain name, often the same), e.g. "Chriss Nexus S
Phone._ubihelper._tcp.local" (mDNS says we should do some multicast
negotiation at the start to ensure our name is unique, adding or
incrementing a trailing number as required, but in our case that might
mean changing name every time we skip network, which is a bit
annoying... After the initial discovery we'll switch to a durable name
(e.g. based on MAC address) for re-discovery (in lieu of Reverse ARP
from an application on an un-rooted phone)... so by remembering
responding IP during initial peering we can at least make something
workable for now)</li>
    <li>Note: Name could be based on (a) Bluetooth device name (not
sure if this can be accessed when Bluetooth disabled)
(android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter.getName() and broadcast
.ACTION_LOCAL_NAME_CHANGED) and (b) "model name" (e.g. Nexus S)
(android.os.Build.MODEL) (See also android.os.Build.SERIAL - may not be
available!) <br>
    </li>
    <li>=&gt; mDNS SRV query for discovered service, case (1) standard
mDNS, lookup of nominally unique name including service name, in our
case&nbsp; targetted at responding IP to avoid ambiguity in initial
workaround implementation (original usage of SRV records) or case (2)
lookup of generic service name/domain, but targetted device IP (cached
or re-discovered); in either case, returns target name (could be IP in
our case) and port&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Sending of peer request to discovered service instance (IP and
port), including first phase of DH key exchange or new passcode
encrypted secure token (may include identification information for peer record)<br>
    </li>
    <li>Notification
of user with option to accept or reject request, typically requiring
independent entry of passcode from initiating device (typically include
identification information for peer record)<br>
    </li>
    <li>Response to initiator and update of initiator peer record</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Once peered, communication requires</li>
  <ul>
    <li>(cached IP/fallback) Reverse-ARP-style IP recovery - e.g. by
mDNS lookup of A record of domain based on WiFi MAC, e.g.
"000000000000._reversearp._udp.local" (Could be PTR lookup but that
should then resolve to (dynamic) local domain name)<br>
    </li>
    <li>(cached port/fallback) SRV query for generic service
name/domain targetted to device IP =&gt; target (should be unnecessary)
and port</li>
    <li>connection establishment to IP and port, authenticated using shared secret</li>
    <ul>
      <li>could be sequence of HTTP requests, or TCP connection used for multiple message exchange</li>
      <li>[IP and port could be an internet service proxy for the
device, probably with its own shared secret, but otherwise could be the
same]<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
Open issues:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Currently using a nasty and incomplete mDNS implementation; could change to an established one, e.g. JmDNS...</li>
</ul>
Ongoing use (with established authenticated connection (or HTTP request sequence)):<br>
<ul>
  <li>Local list of trusted peers</li>
  <li>Get cached information about peer (BT MAC, name, ...?)</li>
  <li>Request channel read from peer (location, compass, ... [state?!])</li>
  <li>Push channel update to peer</li>
  <li>Get communication state (state, last update)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Wire protocol</p>
<p>Goals/constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Message-oriented</li>
<li>doesn't need to interoperate with existing protocol(s)</li><li>
</li><li>Should include protocol declaration/agreement, including version on connection</li>
<li>Should be useful for passing JSON-encoded messages. org.json
marshalls to/from Strings only. So needs to pass UTF-8 encoded strings
as a message primitive. Could be newline separated.</li>
<li>Should work over non-blocking java.nio.SocketChannel</li>
<li>Able in principle to transition to encrypted operation</li>
<li>Asynchronous and bi-directional</li>
<li>Could be abstracted over transport, i.e. TCP vs HTTP</li>
<li>Could include application-level reliability mechanism and fail-over to new connection</li>
<li>Probably useful to include some link-layer abstraction(s), e.g. fragmentation, to allow interleaving</li>
</ul>
<p>Approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of current connection state as analogous to additional HTTP headers, e.g. correlation token, content type</li>
<li>Look at java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder/CharsetDecoder for
encode/decode between java.nio.CharBuffer (in particular String or
StringBuilder, respectively) and (multiple) java.nio.ByteBuffer (over
slice of byte array)</li>
</ul>
<p>"Link-layer" format (byte-encoded basic layer):</p>
<ul>
<li>flags(1 byte):</li>
<ul>
<li>bit 1 (high bit) - more fragments to follow</li>
<li>bit 2 - encrypted</li>
</ul>
<li>payloadtype(1 byte, unsigned):</li>
<ul>
<li>0 - undefined - in continuation fragment see payloadtype in first fragment</li>
<li>1 - hello: "Content-type: application/x-ubihelper;version=N" (should not be fragmented); current version = 1</li>
<li>2 - management: JSON-encoded connection management message</li>
<li>3 - pseudo-http request: request line, optional header lines, blank line, followed by JSON string</li>
<li>4 - pseudo-http response: response line, optional header lines, blank line, followed by JSON string</li>
</ul>
<li>messageid(2 bytes, big-endian, unsigned, incrementing from random or 0, loops)</li>
<li>fragmentid(2 bytes, big-endian, incrementing from 1 (0 if unfragmented), unsigned, bounded 2^16-1)</li>
<li>fragmentlength(2 bytes, big endian, unsigned, bounded 2^16-1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Followed by fragmentlength bytes of payload</p>
<p>When sending text this should be UTF-8 encoded; NL (only) is the line separator (where applicable).</p>
