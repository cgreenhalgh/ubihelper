Version 1.0.</p><p>For people who are developing (e.g.) <a href="http://www.appfurnace.com/">AppFurnace</a> applications using ubihelper.</p><p>See <a href="UbihelperEndUserGuide.html">UbihelperEndUserGuide.html</a> for details on installing and starting/stopping the ubihelper application and service.</p><p>Contents:</p><ul><li><a href="#Overview">Overview</a></li><li><a href="#Channels">Channels</a></li><li><a href="#HTTP_Server">HTTP Server</a></li><li><a href="#Using_the_Emulator">Using the Emulator</a></li></ul><h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>Ubihelper
allows applications running on the phone - such as AppFurnace
applications - to access additional sensor information, such as
Bluetooth discovery, wifi networks, etc. A future version will also
allow access to sensor information from other phones over the network.</p><p>You
don't necessarily need to understand the details in this guide; as a
starting point you may be able to copy fragments of Javascript code and
adapt from there.</p><h2><a name="Channels"></a>Channels</h2><p>The
information that the ubihelper service can provide is organised as a
set of "channels". Each channel has a name and one or more values.
Depending on what the channel represents the value may be constant or
may change over time (e.g. a sequence of readings from a sensor).&nbsp;</p><p>Sensor
channels will have a minimum period between new values (e.g. 1 second
for GPS, 1-2 seconds for a Wifi scan, about 12 seconds for a Bluetooth
scan). But your application can request updates at another rate.</p><p>The
type of value returned by a channel depends on the channel, i.e.
different channel may return completely different kinds of values.</p><p>The
available channels may vary from device to device. If a channel does
not exist on a particular device then no values will be returned from
it. Some of the standard channel names are:</p><ul><li>accelerometer</li><li>bluetooth - scans for discoverable Bluetooth devices</li><li>cell.location - GSM/3G current cell ID</li><li>channels - list of current known channels</li><li>gpsstatus - status of GPS, e.g. available satellites</li><li>gyro</li><li>location.gps - GPS location</li><li>location.network - location based on Cellular and Wifi networks</li><li>magnetic</li><li>pressure</li><li>proximity - the proximity sensor that turns off the mobile's screen when held to your ear for a phone call</li><li>wifi - scans for Wifi access points in range</li></ul><p>From
the ubihelper preferences screen, the option menu "Channels" gives a
list of known channels, which may be viewed (the default update period
for these views is 0.25 seconds, i.e. 4Hz):</p><img style="width: 240px; height: 427px;" alt="channels list" src="images/channels-list.png"> <br><p>For example, the "accelerometer" channel:</p><img style="width: 240px; height: 427px;" alt="accelerometer channel" src="images/accelerometer-channel.png">&nbsp; <br><h2><a name="HTTP_Server"></a>HTTP Server</h2><p>Ubihelper includes a simple HTTP (web) server, which other applications use to get information from the ubihelper service.&nbsp;</p><h3>HTTP Server configuration</h3><p>The port that the server runs on defaults to "8080", and can be configured in the ubihelper preferences:</p><p> <img style="width: 240px; height: 427px;" alt="preferences" src="images/preferences-disabled.png"></p><p>When
requesting informatioon from the ubihelper server a specific URL path
must also be used. By default this is "/ubihelper", but this can also
be changed in the ubihelper preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that if you
change the HTTP server path&nbsp;then any users of you application will
need to configure the same path before running your application.</p><h3>HTTP Server Protocol</h3><p>The
ubihelper HTTP server expects to receive a POST to the URL
http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt; (by default
http://localhost:8180/ubihelper). The body of this post should be a
JSON(UTF-8 encoded) array of objects, with the following properties: </p><ul><li>name - the channel name (string) from which information is requested (see above)</li><li>period
- the desired sampling period (floating point number, seconds), i.e.
the preferred time between samples of a changing value. Optional,
defaults to 1 (second)</li><li>timeout - how long the server should
continue to collect/hold data for the application (floating point
number, seconds). Optional, defaults to 30 (seconds)</li><li>count - how many values the server hold for the application (integer). Optional, defaults to 1, i.e. most recent value only.</li></ul><p>For
example, to request updates every half second from the accelerometer,
waiting up to 20 seconds for the application to collect the data, and
keeping only the most recent value, the application would POST:</p><ul><li>[{"name":"accelerometer", "period":0.5, "timeout":20, "count":1}]</li></ul><p>&nbsp;The server returns a JSON array of objects with the following properties:</p><ul><li>name - the channel name (string)</li><li>values - a JSON array of values that were waiting for the application on that channel.</li></ul><p>The value(s) returned are channel-dependent (see below). For example, the above request might return:</p><ul><li>[{"name":"accelerometer", "values":[{"timestamp":6512246,"accuracy":3,"values":[-0.3826,-0.6923,9.7710]}]}]</li></ul><p>Note:
most channels only start to collect information when the first request
is made by the application. The application should then wait
approximately the requested period and then poll the ubihelper server
to retrieve any available values.</p><h3>Testing the Server</h3><p>From
the main preferences view, the option menu "Test" opens a simple test
view which till post a request to the local server and print the
response, e.g. (after pressing "Test Http" a couple of times on a real
device):</p><p><img style="width: 360px; height: 640px;" alt="test view" src="images/test-view.png"></p><h2><a name="Using_the_Emulator"></a>Using the Emulator</h2><p>At present the ubihelper application can be run in an Android emulator, but will not return any sensor values.&nbsp;</p><p>It is intended to provide some Javascript examples to support initial application development (e.g. in AppFurnace).&nbsp;</p><p>In the interrim testing can only be done on a real device. </p></body></html>
